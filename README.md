# How it Works

**Sound Detection**: The sound sensor measures noise levels and sends the analog data to the ESP8266.

**LED Control**: When specific sensor readings are detected, the LED turns on or off accordingly.

**Cloud Communication**: Using Blynk, the sensor data and LED status are displayed on the mobile app.

**User Feedback**: Users can monitor sound levels and LED status remotely.

# Code Explanation

**Blynk Initialization**: Connects the ESP8266 to the Blynk cloud using authentication tokens.

**Sensor Reading**: Continuously reads data from the KY-038 sensor using analogRead().

**LED Control Logic**: Based on specific sensor values, the LED is toggled using digitalWrite().

**Data Logging**: Sensor data and LED status are transmitted to the Blynk app using Blynk.virtualWrite().
